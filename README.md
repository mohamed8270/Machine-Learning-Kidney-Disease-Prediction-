# Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease using MachineÂ Learning

#### python program to predict and classify patience as having chronic kidney disease (ckd) or not using artificial neural networks

#### Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body

#### In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired

#### Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant

#### The process consiste of building a model and deploy it on IBM Watson machine learning platform, Further creating a web application for interraction and input of user medical parameters such as diabetesmellitus, coroary disease, red blood cells etc to predict the chronic kidney disease. The UI is created using flutter. API is ensured to connect web application and IBM watson machine learning platform where our model is deployed and the data are uploaded into cloud storage in IBM storage fecility
